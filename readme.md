# Weather Dashboard Project 

## Description

This is a functioning weather dashboard that provides the current weather, and a five day forecast for any city that you enter. If you enter an invalid city you would receive an error. You can also see, and select previous searches.

## Usage

Enter just the city name, and hit the search icon. You can then review the weather information for that area. You can also select any of the previous searches on the left panel to view the weather for that city again.
